# Dragon Ball Series Website

## User Experience Design(UXD)

### Overview

This is a website designed for both fans of Dragon Ball Series or people who would like to know more
about Dragon Ball.

### What is this website for?

Dragon Ball Series is a site to attract anime fans from all over the world and especially Dragon Ball
fans. It reveals images about Dragon Ball Series, as well as a little spoiler to make people interested
in the series. The website embeds audioclips with the best songs used throughout the series. Last
but not least, the website allows other contributors to participate to the development of the website 
by adding new content or improving the current one. It also allows users to send emails for project requests
via the contact form.

### How does it work?

The website uses HTML and HTML5 markup language to put the structure of the website in place. It also 
uses CSS and Bootstrap to style the website. These technologies have also been used to construct the
login and signup modal buttons. Javascript and jQuery have helped to the functionality of the 
contact form, as well as login and signup forms. The website can be viewed [here](https://ioanhadarean.github.io/User-Centric-Front-End-Milestone-Project/).
